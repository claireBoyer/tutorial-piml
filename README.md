## Practical Sessions Overview

1- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).**
This session introduces the architecture of PINNs and demonstrates their use in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and in hybrid modeling.

2- **Kernel Methods.**
This session covers the mathematical foundations of kernel methods, including key concepts like the kernel trick. It also explores applications to electricity load forecasting using polynomial and Sobolev kernels.

3- **Physics-Informed Kernel Learners (PIKL).**
This session presents kernel methods informed by PDEs. It includes an introduction to the *pikernel* Python package (see [https://pypi.org/project/pikernel/](https://pypi.org/project/pikernel/)), which offers efficient CPU and GPU implementations of PIKL.
